# About TIMS - Translational Informatics Management System
TIMS is an OMICS based clinical data management open-source software that curates study-related clinical information, manages the raw processing of diverse OMICS datasets to a preprocessed analysis ready state and finally visualizes the clinical information and processed output in a single access-controlled and audit trailed environment. Most importantly, this data management system provides the skeletal open-source software framework for which any appropriate OMICS pipelines and visualizers can be integrated seamlessly in a scaleable fashion.
