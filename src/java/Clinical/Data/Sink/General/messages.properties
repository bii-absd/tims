probe.filtering=Filtering probes according to certain criteria, such as low expression or non-uniquely mapped probes
phenotype.column=The phenotype of interest to label the samples in the report
probe.selection=Probe selection (most variable) when there are multiple probes targeting the same gene
sample.averaging=Gene expression is averaged according to the selected column (eg: tehnical replicates)
standardization=Standardize means gene expression is standardized to mean 0 and stdev 1 across all the samples
